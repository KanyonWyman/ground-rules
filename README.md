# Our Code Creed

## Objective

To create an app, that builds connections between the local gaming community . 

## Communication

The slack group, or group text message will be the main avenue of communication. The team understands that communication is key to acheive our overall objective. 

## Situations

Keep communication lines open, let eveyone be aware of what may be preventing us from acheiving our objective. If we have a situation that is out of our control, just inform everyone in the group of what is going on. It's okay, life happens! 

## Let's Get Togehter

**Weekends -** Every week, lets outline if we should meet up durng the weekend or not. Let's have an outline in place the Wednesday prior to the weekend asto if we need to meet during the weekend or not and at what time.  Of course we work in a fast paced envoirment, so adjustments may need to be made depending on the final two days of the week. 

**After work -** The group recognizes that tehre may be times that we may need to stay after work (class) to accomplish some goals that we may need to acheive.  However, given the nature of our spread out location, and transportation this method will be planned out in advance as best as possible.
